                                        <p>Cats have a strong bond with their human companions, often showing affection by rubbing against them, purring, or kneading with their paws. 
                                            Their mysterious and playful behavior, combined with moments of warmth and companionship makes them endlessly fascinating to cat lovers.

                                            <li>Cats sleep a lot: On average, cats spend around 13 to 16 hours a day sleeping. This helps conserve their energy for short bursts of activity, similar to their wild ancestors.</li>
                                            <li>Purring serves multiple purposes: Cats purr when they’re happy, but they also purr to comfort themselves when stressed, in pain, or even while recovering from illness.</li>                
                                            <li>Unique “meows”: Cats develop specific meows for communicating with their owners, and some cats will alter their vocalizations to get attention, food, or affection.</li>                
                                            <li>Cats are territorial: Cats are very territorial animals, often marking their space with scent glands located on their face, paws, and tail. This behavior helps them establish boundaries with other animals.</li>  
                                            <li>Cats have “right” or “left” paws: Much like humans being right- or left-handed, cats tend to favor one paw over the other for tasks like grabbing objects or stepping forward.</li>          
                                            <li>They can’t taste sweetness: Unlike humans, cats lack taste receptors for sweetness, meaning sugary treats don’t hold the same appeal for them.</li>

                                Each cat has a distinct personality, with some being more social and others preferring solitude. 
                                Interestingly, cats groom themselves regularly, not just to keep clean, but also to regulate their body temperature and manage stress.
